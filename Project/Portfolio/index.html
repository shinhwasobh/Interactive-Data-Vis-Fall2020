  <h4 class="tab">The Relationship between Poverty and Chronic Absence in NYC Schools</h4>
  <p class="tab">
    According to public data published by NYC Department of Education (
        <a 
        href = "https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/">NYC Open Data</a>
    ), there is a significant clustering of schools in Brooklyn and Bronx where chronic absence rates are higher than other neighborhoods. 
    <br>This exploratory project is a simple representation of positive relationship between "Poverty Index Score" and "Chronic Absence Rate" in NYC's 1,100+ schools as well as their clustering patterns via interactive scatterplot graph.

  <h4 class="tab">The Relationship between Low Birth Rate and Unemployment Rate in South Korea </h4>
  <p class="tab">
    The Republic of Korea has maintained its reputation of having one of the lowest birthrates in the world in recent decades. 
    Like other neighboring countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, and Singapore, <br>South Korea has experienced a steady decrease in population size 
    as a result of this low fertility rate (
        <a 
        href = "https://worldpopulationreview.com/">World Population Review, 2020</a>).
        Whether it is a mixed blessing or not, the country has already been seeing <br>some substantial socio-political and economic changes as a consequence of low fertility rates. As a generational issue, it's our crucial moment to prepare this anticipated social transition politically and socially.
