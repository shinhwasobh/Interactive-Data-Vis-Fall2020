  <h4 class="tab">The Relationship between Poverty and Chronic Absence in NYC Schools</h4>
  <p class="tab">
    According to public data published by NYC Department of Education (
        <a 
        href = "https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/">NYC Open Data</a>
    ), there is a significant clustering of schools in Brooklyn and Bronx where chronic absence rates are higher than other neighborhoods. 
    <br>This exploratory project is a simple representation of positive relationship between "Poverty Index Score" and "Chronic Absence Rate" in NYC's 1,100+ schools as well as their clustering patterns via interactive scatterplot graph.

  <h4 class="tab">The Relationship between Low Birth Rate and Unemployment Rate in South Korea </h4>
  <p class="tab">
    The Republic of Korea has maintained its reputation of having one of the lowest birthrates in the world in recent decades. 
    Like other neighboring countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, and Singapore, <br>South Korea has experienced a steady decrease in population size 
    as a result of this low fertility rate (
        <a 
        href = "https://worldpopulationreview.com/">World Population Review, 2020</a>).
        Whether it is a mixed blessing or not, the country has already been seeing <br>some substantial socio-political and economic changes as a consequence of low fertility rates. As a generational issue, it's our crucial moment to prepare this anticipated social transition politically and socially.

  <h3><br>3. Reflection</h3>
  <p class="important" >Throughout the semester practicing data visualization with tutorials and projects (Exploratory & Narrative), it's been all about making the decisions on how to explain the data in a satisfying way.
      <br><br>What messages am I trying to convey via this data visualization? <br>What types of graph would be the best for conveying the message? <br>What kinds of design/format would be appealing to the audience? <br>How can I execute my design decision using d3.js and other tools?
      <br><br>There are so many questions I had to think through, and having a brainstorming process before executing my idea provides myself with a general direction of what I would like to share through the project.
      <br>Practicing class tutorials and reviewing materials provided in the class every week allowed me to understand what data visualization really is and how it should be by incorporating various perspectives. 
      <br>The lectures are not only covering technical aspects of visualization, but also exploring ethical, political, and philosophical sides of data visualization which highlights the power of what we are learning.
      <br>I wish I could be able to engage myself more outside of the class by reviewing extra materials and practicing more advanced-level tutorials to hone my skills and create more well-designed project results.
      <br>Although I could not produce satisfying results with intended designs during the whole semester due to time constraints and lack of practices, it has been one of the most delightful and enjoyable course.
