        The Republic of Korea has maintained its reputation of having one of the lowest birthrates in the world in recent years. Even though it is a controversial issue whether this population trend brings positive or negative results for South Korea, it is certain that this would cause dramatic changes in social, political and economic environments due to the population shrinkage. This low fertility trend has been maintained its momentum for more than 30 years, and the country has already been seeing some substantial socio-political and economic changes such as social welfare crisis for elderly with aging population pyramid. This project is presenting a snapshot of current population characteristics with some visualizations.

          This population trend with lower birthrate is not only South Korea's issue. 
          Except for a few countries, almost all countries have been experiencing 
          historically-low fertility rate and accompanying population aging. 
          This bar graph shows the average total fertility rate (TFR) in 2017 
          in some of well-developed nations around the world, including Mexico, 
          New Zealand, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, United States of America, 
          and Canada. To begin with, TFR is the average number of children that would 
          be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years 
          and born children according to a given fertility rate at each age. As of 2017, 
          it ranged from 6.49 (Nigeria) to 0.83 (Singapore). In general, developing 
          countires are more likely to have higher TFR than developed countries.

          South Korea, on average, has a TFR of 1.26 (2017 EST.) which is one of the 
          countries with the lowest TFR around the world. Interestingly, there is a 
          variation exist on domestic level, and each city has different level of fertility 
          rate. Some cities have higher TFR than the rest, and this bar graph shows the TFR 
          in South Korea metro cities including Sejong, Jeju, Ulsan, Daejeon, Gwangju, Busan, 
          Seoul, Daegu and Incheon. While visualizing each city's TFR, I investigated a little 
          further on why these cities have such variation in TFR. In this variation, there must 
          be some significant factors affecting people's decisions or behaviors on having a baby.
          For example, marriage, unemployment, financial situation, housing condition, and many
          other variables need to be reviewed.

          After visualizing the relationship between various social indicators (stress level, suicide rates, economic status, etc.), it seems that there is a negative relationship between each city's average unemployment rate and TFR. The scatterplot is showing a pattern of negative slope indicating that cities with higher unemployment rate tends to have lower TFR.
